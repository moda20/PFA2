title: Symfony Security: Beautiful Authentication, Powerful Authorization

summary: |
    Ah, security! Quick run!

    Wait, come back! Security in Symfony is *awesome*! Seriously,
    between things called "voters" and the Guard authentication
    system, you can do anything you want inside of Symfony, and
    the code to do it is simple and expressive.

    Security has two sides: authentication (who are you?) and
    authorization (do you have access to do X). We'll talk about
    each of these, creating an traditional form login system
    *and* and API token authentication system using Json web tokens
    (not as scary as they sound!). Then, we'll turn to authorization,
    with roles, voters and other good stuff:

    * Security & Firewall Fundamentals
    * Creating a custom login form
    * Making a User (ooOOOoo)
    * User Providers (why you need them, but don't care)
    * Password Encryption
    * Logging out!
    * Protecting entire URLs with access_control(s)
    * IS_AUTHENTICATED_FULLY, IS_AUTHENTICATED_REMEMBERED
    * Checking access with roles! ROLE_USER
    * Denying access in a controller
    * What are voters?
    * Role hierarchies
    * Impersonation (`switch_user`)
    * Registration Form
    * Manual authentication

    ... and how to create a back door into your site. Just kidding!
    Let's make some secure sites!
